# Renaming and Editing Component Descriptions

In Langflow 1.0, we introduced the capability to not only create and manage components but also to customize them further by renaming and editing their descriptions. This feature is aimed at enhancing user experience by allowing for a clearer understanding of each component's role and functionality within your flow. Let's dive into how you can make these adjustments to improve clarity in your projects.

## Renaming Components

Renaming a component in Langflow is a straightforward process. This functionality is crucial for maintaining a clear and understandable workflow, especially as your projects grow in complexity. Here's how you can rename a component:

<ZoomableImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: "img/rename-component.gif",
    dark: "img/rename-component.gif",
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

1. Navigate to the component you wish to rename.
2. Click on the component's title two time, or on the pen close to it, to activate the editing mode.
3. Type in the new name and press `Enter` or click outside the text box to save the changes.

This simple change can make a significant difference in understanding the component's customized purpose or functionality, which can be referenced in tweaks, the API, errors, and the interaction panel.

<ZoomableImage

  sources={{
    light: "img/tweaks-rename-reference.png",
    dark: "img/tweaks-rename-reference.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "100%" }}
/>

## Editing Component Descriptions

Editing a component's description allows you to provide more detailed information about what the component does, its inputs and outputs, and any specific instructions or notes. To edit a component's description:

1. Select the component for which you want to edit the description.
2. Double click in the description text itself to begin editing.
3. Enter your new description and press `Enter` or click outside the text box to save the changes.

## Why is this useful?

Customizing the names and descriptions of your components can significantly improve the legibility and manageability of your flows. It helps new users of your flow understand the purpose of each component at a glance and can make debugging and iterating on your flow much easier.
