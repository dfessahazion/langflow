# Sidebar and Interaction Panel 

## TLDR;

- The sidebar now includes new components: Inputs and Outputs. You can directly interact with them from the interaction panel.
- Inputs are for ingesting data into the flow; they can be edited directly from the interaction panel.
- Outputs are for outputting data from the flow; they can be viewed directly from the interaction panel.
- The interaction panel is a new feature that allows you to interact with certain components and run the flow more user-friendly.
- The chat modal has been removed; now chat is integrated into the interaction panel. You can use a chat interface with the Chat Input and/or Chat Output components.
- Any updates made in the interaction panel will be reflected in the flow.
- We value your feedback on this; please let us know how it works for you and what you think.
- Suggestions for new Inputs and Outputs are welcome.

## Introduction
Langflow now operates optimally with a flow containing both an Input and an Output, which are the primary components you'll need to integrate into your existing flows.

The sidebar has been enhanced with new components: Inputs and Outputs. Utilize these components to interact seamlessly with your flow.

An Input is designed for data ingestion into the flow, while an Output facilitates data output from the flow.

Now, every flow can be constructed and utilized directly from the interaction panel, eliminating the constant need to edit the flow on the canvas.

By defining inputs and outputs, you can treat the flow as a black box, interacting with it solely by providing inputs and observing outputs.

Langflow has transitioned from being a chat platform; however, you can still incorporate a chat interface using the Chat Input and/or Chat Output components. Now, Langflow serves as a versatile tool for constructing AI flows for various purposes.
